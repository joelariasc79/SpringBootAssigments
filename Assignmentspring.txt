Create a Hotel Management System, where you have 2 spring boot project as mentioned below:
1. TravelGig - 8282
2. HotelMicroservice - 8383

In TravelGig you have a form Hotel.html as show below:

Add Hotel:

HotelName:<TextBox>
Address:<TextBox>
ContactDetails:<TextBox>
Email:<TextBox>

AddHotel<Button>

On the click of button you have to perform below:
1. Make a Ajax call to your TravelGig Controller GatewayController
2. Handle the request by accepting JsonNode as the requestbody
3. GatewayController will invoke the component HotelClient and send a Post request to the HotelMicroservice with JsonNode as HttpEntity object
4. HotelMicorservice has Hotel as the domain object and will be having HotelService to save the hotel object using HotelRepository.
5. While HotelMicroservice returns the Hotel object back to the TravelGig with the persistant HotelObject along with auto generated ID
 that is a primary key of Hotel Domain Entity
6. While returning the Hotel Object as JsonNode add another property with the name UniqueId with Id and dateofcreation appended
 as one of the key value.
7. Once the response is received back by Hotel.html display the UniqueId in a alert box with a message "Hotel with UniqueId is stored"
